# Vazier-release
Binary installers and documentation for Vazier

Vazier is a program for designing vases with curved staves.
It creates a 3d model (.stl) for an individual stave.  
Staves are then cut on a CNC router, glued up and turned on a lathe.

This is only useful if you have access to both a CNC router and a lathe.
